ðŸŽ“ Face Recognition Attendance System
A real-time, AI-powered student attendance system using face recognition and MongoDB. This project automates the traditional attendance process by recognizing student faces through a webcam, verifying their identity, and logging attendance securely in a cloud database.

ðŸ§© Key Features
âœ… Real-Time Face Detection & Recognition
âœ… Webcam Feed with Live Bounding Boxes
âœ… Student Info Display with Clean UI
âœ… Visual Mode Indicators (Searching, Found, Error, etc.)
âœ… MongoDB Integration for Data Storage
âœ… Highly Customizable and Scalable

ðŸ“¸ How It Works
The webcam captures live video feed.

Detected faces are compared with known encodings.

If matched, student details are fetched from MongoDB.

A status panel shows the studentâ€™s Name, Major, Year, and Total Attendance.

A visual mode image below the webcam indicates the systemâ€™s current state (e.g., scanning, success, error).

Attendance is confirmed and optionally stored.
